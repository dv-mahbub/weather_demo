# Weather Demo Task for Steadfast IT

This is a demonstration of an Weather App. It includes a Splash Screen, a Location Tracking Page and Forecast page for preview weather forecast data.

The app is designed to load data once and store it locally using sqflite, allowing users to access the data even when there is no internet connection.

GPS service is used to track user's current location.

Additionally, a basic logo animation has been implemented on the Splash Screen for a more engaging user experience.
